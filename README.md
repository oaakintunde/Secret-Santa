# Secret_Santa

Welcome to my Secret Santa script. Its use is pretty basic and easy to follow.

## Instructions

1. Fill out the text file with the names of the people that should be included for the Secret Santa.
2. For exceptions, i.e., the names that are not to be paired with the person in the list, write those names in brackets next to Secret Santa.
   - Example format: `Yusuke Urameshi (Naruto Uzomaki, Arturia Pendragon)`
3. Make sure there is an even number of names in the list.
4. Run the script.

## Limitations

Please note the following limitations:

1. If there are too many exceptions, the script might not run or take a while to complete.
2. There has to be an even number of names in the list.
3. The text file has to be in the same folder as the script
